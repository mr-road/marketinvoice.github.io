F# is a brilliant language based on the ML family of langugaes that runs on the .Net platform.


The language is well suited to many problems domains and the flexible, immutable first and lightweight type system can help create programs that are terse, readble and less open to writting some forms of bug.


Being able to leverage all lessons learned and the existing build pipeline is also big plus.


The language is not suitable to all problem domains, especially where performance gains by using mutable data structures are needed however.


Data team are using R Type provider for code generation already.
