To take charge of our logging we are looking into using a hosted and managed loggign platform. This should provide both a high bandwidth interface for adding tracing to our projects and a comprehensive reporting and querying engine.

We have choosen to go with Logentries because of it's plug and play simplicity and .Net support as well as it's batteries included reporting platform.

Other options included, loggly, papertrail, splunk or our own implementation of the ELK stack.
