The client code is getting more and more complex and a good way to auto generate documentation from the code directly would greatly help while we expand.

More teams using the code could well lead to confusion, code duplication and verisoning hell without a decent handle on what we have and how we can use it.

The JSDoc tool is a great documentation generator tool for use with Javascript. Need to trial it with the typescript code base. Maybe look for alternatives if they make more sense.
