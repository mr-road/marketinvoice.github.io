The client code is getting more and more complex and a good way to auto generate view model code from the server for use on the client would be really great.

It seems the awesome TypeLite tool is the forerunner in being able to do this. It simply consumes any C# code that you point it to and spits out a typescript definition file that can be consumed by the client code compiler to make sure any data coming fro mthe server is type checked. 

Typescript has already proved it's productivity boosting ability in the team and it would be good to close the bridge between the relative type safety we now have on the client over the wire.
