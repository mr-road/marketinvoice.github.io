In the last 2 weeks or so [Ivan](http://ivanz.com) has given a helping hand to Jonathan Wilkins with the MSpec Visual Studio adapter project. The initial main focus was to get the adapter nuget ready, so that it can be used in Visual Studio Online (now Team Services) seamlessly. [Ivan](http://ivanz.com) has also set-up a CI environment in AppVeyor: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/machine-visualstudio/machine-vstestadapter
